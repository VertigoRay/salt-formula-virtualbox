Which do you think would be better?
CAS could benefit from this/maybe your HPC cluster. I want to push one of these into a docker container
(hopefully I can do this without a blockchain)

or.. ITSS whoever is in control of your UNT infrastructure on the larger HPC cluster.

But, I have been baffled by the bigger question. Do I implement a central or decentralized database anyway?
And, how do I even handle the shell output from running tasks?

I really want to create a hybrid docker blockchain that is decentralized with access control. Leveraging the blockchain for database storage, maybe turning it into an actual cryptocurrency on the global market (mind you, with no ICO but selling for a cheap price to compete with the dragonchain I got burned on..... a coin is the only way you could HAVE a global HPC cluster in the sense.)

I came across software called coinclone, but, I have no intention of "mining blocks" but instead, paying for uptime (hopefully through a decentralized global network database.... That i'd prefer to be a blockchain for "millenial" appeal.)

These are mainly highdeas, but if you have any input or thoughts, let me know! I think it could go very far to create a public decentralied grid computing infrastructure if the price is based on performance. But how can you even measure performance like that when you are running multitudes of different task-consuming commands, let alone secure that type of payment system

Thanks,
